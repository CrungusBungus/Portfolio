    <p class = "ArticleText">Recently, I made a functional dialogue system where players can talk to npcs! These npcs will be able to give players access to special shops or quests. I still have to animate the npcs to bring these guys some life but that shouldn't be too hard. This next update is going to be pretty good one I think. So far we have 3, maybe 4, npcs that players will be able to interact with.</p>
