      <h2> What is Monolith Defense? </h2>
    <p class = "ArticleText">Monolith Defense is the game that I'm currently focusing on. It's a tower defense on roblox that features little dudes and fish you can place down to beat enemies. It also features an expansive tech tree to upgrade your towers as well as powerful abilities that you can use to turn the tide of battle. It also features multiplayer capabilities with up to 4 players. This is the game that I'll mainly be posting about on here.</p>
