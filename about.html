      <h2> What is this website? </h2>
    <p class = "articletext">Hello, I am Keanu Cooley. This is my website for posting about my game development stuff. My portfolio for the journey I'm taking with game development. Currently I'm mainly doing stuff on Roblox, a platform that allows anyone to create games. Roblox specializes in Lua, which is the programming language I'm most comfortable with. I also know a bit of python, html, c++, and a little bit of java. I'm currently still focusing on Lua as I'm still doing development on Roblox. Namely, on my main game, Monolith Defense. You can read more about the game in the games tab. Any other games that I'll be working will be posted in the games tab. The Game Updates tab are updates for my games that I'm working on that I'll be posting, not there yet. Random stuff will just be random things that I decide to create. They'll be related to game development in some way but not necessarily related to one of the games I'm making.</p>
